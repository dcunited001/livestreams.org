Last week, I left a past/present/future reading out, so I could blankly stare at
it while philosophizing about and aimlessly wondering my abode. Today, I
shuffled and did a new reading (same type) before another stream that I had
planned. Two of three cards were the same, but in a different position. The
orientation of the cards were reversed and in a different position, but if you
drop those conditions, then the odds of that occurring are (1/78)^2... Hmmmm.


This is my interpretation, but it also gave me an idea for a general type of
reading, using the idea of convolutions from math and data science. It's not
that complicated, but should be pretty interesting to apply to simple spreads.
For the past/present/future spread, you would draw (n + 2) cards -- no algebra
required, I swear! So, n is the number of past/present/future cards to do in a
row. Instead of drawing the "present" card first, you consider that to be the
second card drawn. Then, you simply look at each triple of cards, three at a
time, as though one day's present and future is the next day's past and present.
So, if you did an (n=3) spread, then you would draw 5 cards:


- Day 1 Cards: (1, 2, 3)
- Day 2 Cards: (2, 3, 4)
- Day 3 Cards: (3, 4, 5)


And then you simply consider: how would I feel about the next three days if they
turned out like that. Meditate on it a bit, but keep in mind (IMO) Tarot is
bullshit and it's only not bullshit if you don't take it too seriously.


I say that in jest! Believe what you want, but don't allow yourself to be led
astray. Tarot can be good or bad or used to influence someone.


Let me know what you think if you decide to try it.


Also keep in mind that Tarot is like a mirror, depending on how detached you are
from the query/seeker -- and that is 10 times as true when doing readings for
yourself. Perhaps try it with a friend, someone you trust.
