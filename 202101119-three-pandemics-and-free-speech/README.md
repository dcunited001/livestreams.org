# Polymathic Perfraction

Welcome to another entry in my rambling Polymathic Perfraction series. 

This is on social media censorship, the Parler/Amazon case, the Rumble/Google case and innumerable tangents.

Like all the other videos in this series, it will be a random walk through humanity's collective epistemological heritage. There will be tangents... so if they don't interest you, skip ahead or pick a random starting point in the video. 

I'd love to hear your feedback, so feel free to comment on anything, but be warned: I'm very opinionated ... I'm also willing to discuss pretty much anything and if you don't understand my points, that's fine. I'm more than willing to accommodate with a book recommendation. I don't intend to talk down to anyone, but these videos are not at all filtered by mass appeal ... if you don't like it, I don't care. 

Intended destinations on our epistemological journey:

- Vote with your dollar AND "Vote with their dollar"
- The Amazon Prime movie "One Day In Miami" and why it should probably be required viewing in America. It's a movie that has tremendous healing potential for our country and that's something that is so badly needed right now.
- The 3 pandemics America faces right now.
- On the importance of Freedom of Speech and fair press access to the movements of MLK Jr and Gandhi ... and any movement based around the tactics of Civil Disobedience and Passive Resistance.
- The best way to go about deleting various social media accounts.
- Why you'll be much happier once experiencing a new life without social media.
- How to backup your social media data (and why your backup shouldn't be online)
- A hypothetical way to EMP harden your backup
- Monopolies v. Antitrusts
- "Activist Engineers": heads are going to roll at Twitter and Amazon.
- Man v. Aliens: Artificial Intelligence could cause humanity to rally for it's own good.
- Parler & Amazon's perspectives on the case.
- Users have more leverage than they know (filtered words, 
- Access on social media and speaking out isn't worth being targeted.
- A new mission for Black Lives Matter

# Three Pandemics

Without even venturing into sociocultural disintegration, THERE ARE **THREE**
PANDEMICS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

### Coronavirus



### Psychological Effects of Isolation



### Neurological Effects Via Overuse of Disinfectants



# Freedom of Speech

### Pull The Plug on Propaganda

- MLK Jr. and Gandhi's tactics simply do not work without the ability to have
  other people witness and react to your suffering.
  - if platforms of free speech are threatened, so is the viability of passive
    resistance and civil obedience.
    - why didn't you see civil disobedience in Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany?
      Because no one could talk about the people who were suffering, if they
      even knew.

### I've Got A Bad Feeling About This




# But Maybe It Will Be A Good Change


### The Hill

- videos from earlier today


### Other News Sources (like Epoch Times)




# How to backup your social media

### How to backup your social media data

- this is your data, it belongs to you

### How to physically secure your social media data

- the trend of censorship will become a trend of deletion
  - they will DELETE your past and unperson you!

- deleting Trump from Home Alone 2 is Stalinesque
  - don't be a fool tomorrow. be prepared today.
  - that data is your leverage

- do not store this data on a network-connected computer!!
- use an SD flash card.
  - five layers of prodection to harden your data against EMP
  - flashcard, inside plastic bag, inside aluminum foil, inside a plastic bag
  - wrap this in as much copper wire as possible (bonus protection: connect to ground)
    - one layer of coated copper wire, one layer of raw wire.
  - store this in a plastic bag & wrap in aluminum foil
    - bury it like gold, if you want.
  - if you connect to ground, make it the only component of a circuit whose
    individual connection leads to ground (this requires a bit of electrical
    engineering experience)

### Contact advertisors to indicate that you've deleted your account

- this is for bonus leverage. this is part of voting with THEIR DOLLAR
- find the advertisers that seem to have targeted you most, for whatever reason.
  - find the top three advertisors that you feel paid most to influence your
    purchasing behavior
  - contact their marketing department. 
  - nothing big, just find a **random** email address in their
    marketing/analytics/management
  - just tell them that: 
    - FB can no longer track your internet usage
    - you can no longer be marketed to on Facebook
    - the cost of marketing to you is going to increase
    - your free time to invest in yourself is going to increase
    - you're going to be much happier this decade than last decade
    - you're going to remake yourself and use your time to become more affluent
    - and you are an independent thinker unlike other people who are
      over-marketed to and tapped out.

# Parler Anti-Trust Case

### Parler's Perspective

### Amazon's Perspective

- what is a monopoly?
  - what is "tying"?
  - Google and Youtube are perhaps an example of tying.
    - We didn't know that at the time, but *perhaps* it's clear now
  - perhaps more interesting than Parler v. Amazon is Rumble v. Google

### Why the Monopoly Test Fails, But the Antitrust Question is Open

- what is an antitrust?
  - what are "shadow-ties" ? 

### Why A Fair Market Circumvents the Need for Monopoly/Antitrust Actions?

- if the legal option of anti-monopoly actions are a really big hammer
  - the anti-trust actions are like the "nuclear option"
    - a la the Senate's nuclear option

### Why Antitrust actions are bad for America

- American tech has been essential for our economic leadership.

### Why "Activist Engineers" should shut up and think

- just because you're the smartest and most talented in a few fields doesn't
  mean that you are
  - the "rule by twitter hivemind" model of governance is terrible
  - the left has miscalculated so, so, so much over the past 5 years. take it as
    the hard lesson that it's meant to be
  - the far-left (and the far-right) doesn't necessarily want or need America,
    our system(s) or "their" project to succeed: 
    - THEY SIMPLY NEED THE SYSTEMS OF OTHER ACTORS TO FAIL.
    - They were helping themselves the whole time. Now, if that was obvious, it
      would also be easy to avoid. they work by obfuscation, delegation,
      confusion, etc.
    - it's so much easier to break things than it is to run them or repair them
  - this is the hole that Americans find ourselves in now.

### Heads are going to roll at Twitter

- So now add India, Germany, Australia, Saudi Arabia and others to the list of
  nations who've either spoken out against or enacted response to Twitters 
 "proactionary" measures against Trump.
 - if they can do it to the most powerful person in America (or the world), they
   can do it to you.
 - The rest of the world is a little sick of how America's been running the
   world's internet. However, this has always been in the best interest of the
   internet as an OPEN PLATFORM FOR FREE COMMUNICATION AND FREE TRADE
   - we've opened a can of worms here. in the past, America's best and brightest
     have been designing and building out systems that even they can barely
     understand. now the world has had more than a generation of people alive
     since the broad adoption of the internet

- but who opened that can of worms anyways? 
  - i'm not going to find myself living in a communist nation.
  - i've studied way too much history to let those drunk on power and greed have
    the unrestrained technical power of the internet.
  - so if i can speak out now, i will do that
  - it is not in our interest to destroy what we've built, but simply the best
    of intentions do not, by themselves, necessarily produce the best outcomes.

### Man VS Aliens

- why are we our own worst enemy?
  - we fight each other over what will seem petty in the future (in the context
    of using tech for censorship). but we should be far more concerned about
    what this technology can do in the hands of far more powerful people,
    actors, nations and ... aliens?
  - what if we spent all this energy against each other just to find that AI is
    the worst tyrant of all?

### So What about Parler and Amazon?

- it is not in Amazon's interest to win their case.
  - it is far more against Amazon's interests to lose.
  - in game theory: this is a lose/lose situation for Amazon
    - if Amazon wins on the claims of violation of contract, Amazon looks like
      they can hit the "cancel" button for anyone and everyone. 
      - That's bad for business. That's real bad for business.
    - Amazon may win on the antitrust claims because it's hard to demonstrate
      the potential "conspiracy" between Amazon, Google, Facebook and Twitter
      - but it's still bad for business. it's probably good for the industry,
        both PaaS cloud-providers and SaaS cloud service tenants
        - for customers hosting cloud software: 
          - redundancy is more expensive at the outset -- very expensive in
            terms of personnel, processes and storage/hosting costs, no to
            mention the complexity & security concerns of pushing data shards to
            multiple geographically-independent facilities *WITHOUT LOSS OF
            FUNCTIONALITY*
          - while this is true, for the time being, this will accelerate the
            adoption of tech processes to distribute data more widely *while
            also giving these companies options to avoid*
        - for cloud providers: 
          - being able to demostrate fair competition and fair market conditions
            helps avoid antitrust/monopoly claims
          - the push for redundancy boosts revenues while also helping their
            customers maintain contunuity of operations

### we should avoid a balkanized internet

  - potential concerns about GDPR
    - if all your data is in one place, it would be potentially easier to censor
      someone or "disappear" all their copies of data
    - that is a hypothetical concern and i'm sure that european leaders have
      already thought this out. according to Occam's razor, their concerns about
      citizens' rights to privacy takes precedence over a hypothetical
      possibility of censorship
- a Balkanized Internet yields many other potential problems



# What To Do About Social Media

### A Social Media "Speed Run"

- not for people with huge followings... unless you bout to be canceled?
  - speed run techs are listed below.

### Protest with Youtube Filtered Words List

#### @GOOGLE: THIS IS QUID PRO QUO IN RESPONSE FOR THE DEMONETIZATION OF EPOCH TIMES AND NTD

- this affects search engine optimization
  - it will cause your own account to suffer, but hey, do you want to get
    cancelled without a whimper?
  - this may also affect the scoring of credibility/trustworthiness/etc for
    various accounts who might post on your channel
    - however, if there is widespread adoption of this by conservative voices,
      it will create a lashback for youtube, who already seems like they are
      censoring conservatives

- this won't last long, but to fix the problem, youtube (or whoever) will have
  to address this in their own machine learning algorithms WHICH IS EXPENSIVE
  - in other words, they'll have to pay design/engineering costs and they'll be
    forced to address other similar filtering that they do for many of these
    keywords
  - of course, they can simply blacklist common words from being permitted, but
    the meaning of words varies per language (as people who speak a language or
    two are wont to know from time to time...)
    - that is, Google will have to incorporate the logic of language into the
      common words they filter from chat/comments. a common word in one language
      is a common translingual homonym or neologism (LOL) in another.

- mainly, IN PROTEST, YOU'LL BE FUCKING UP **SEO** _FOR GOOGLE_
    
here's my list of censored keywords

- nazi,censor,fascist,fascism,black,white,yellow,green,blue,violet,indigo
- big,tall,or,of,him,her,he,she,what,whats,hey,hi,hello,dc,david,conner,trump,hitler
- forty two,42,four,for,where,with,take,make,up,down,inside,outside,in,out,throughout,
- after,before,then,when,once,twice,three,times,a lady,
- good,well,bad,cool,have,see,rofl,bye,why,come,go,went,give,
- top,bottom,most,least,more,less,new,old,within,about,without,around,wherein

as a protest, it's probably more useful to block less common (and random) words

### 

### Deleting your account will cause a lashback for social media

- you have leverage and YOU HAVE POWER. 
  - "power to the people"
  - most social energy types arise from the people first. it is **people who create power!** 

### Social Media Stole Your Face

- (depersonalization)q

### Deplatform Social Media's Business Model

- I'm sorry... all I have is in this deck is "Counterspell"
  - blue decks are always so fun to play against


### AVOID BEING TARGETED!

- at this point, social media has become nothing more than an echo chamber at
  best or, worse, a placebo that makes you feel heard ... or worse, a place to
  identify yourself as someone to be targeted for political/religious beliefs.
- do not become victimized by the social attrition of the left simply to "voice
  your opinion" -- when you KNOW that your opinion will change NO MINDS.

### Find a way out of your abusive relationship

- Facebook (unconsciously) needs you to despair over life without social media
  - they think it's impossible for you to leave, but *they need YOU to believe
    that.* Maybe it's true. Maybe this is the future. MAYBE IT'S NOT!

### If you must manage a page, find someone to do it for you

- the more left leaning, the more they will unintentionally make your
  page/group/organization blend in.
  - while it's important to be authentic (it is not important, it is crucial),
    you do not need to take shit from these people.
    - so make a leftist feel in charge: let them run your damn page and waste
      their time in their own deafining echo chamber.

### Vote With Your Doller

- you get to do this EVERY FUCKING DAY
- SO DO IT. Go get you some leverage.

### VOTE WITH THEIR DOLLAR

### Facebook Tracks ALL Of Your Social Media

- this is perhaps the most powerful leverage that we the people have against Big
  Tech. if they can't track us or if their data becomes incredibly biased, then
  their business models become threatened.

### Learn a new language

- changing your language will result in drastically different recommendations.
  - you will learn how Google/FB markets to various non-english speaking
    demographics by observing:
    - how these recommendations change for you
    - and their vocabulary choices for various UI/UX
  - you will also break social media marketing aggregators' ability to *collate*
    data from various sources.

#### Hacking becomes a bit more difficult (sometimes)

- basically, in some cases, users that use multiple primary languages in
  apps/API's increases the amount of prior knowledge a hacker needs when
  targeting you... for many reasons. 
  - (oops! i bet you didn't realize you left a trail, did you?)

  - hackers writing scripts that access UI/UX elements must make a choice:
    - either write brittle scripts that access HTML/App elements by:
      - relative placement (e.g. something like relative selenium selectors)
      - element ID (which can have randomization applied to confound the
        ability to scrape data)
      - element labels (by far the easiest)
    - the more errors and idiosyncratic behavior their scripted behavior leaves
      behind, the easier it is to distinguish the hacker's behavior from
      authentic user/app behavior. machine learning to achieve this is a fairly
      common technique these days ... but a botnet confounds this (doesn't it
      always?)
  - hackers can always simply compromise an API token (which can be detected by
    comparing the routes/destinations of IP traffic for SSL tunnels; far more
    difficult to detect)
    - they can also simply open a shell and export, but when using API's or
      scraping, this makes it look like *you* are the one accessing the data.
  - but you MUST know the language well enough to cope with UI/UX changes,
    privacy controls, account security, etc.
    - AND IT'S SO FUCKING SIMPLE, MWA HAHAHA, BUT IT *BREAKS EVERYTHING*

#### This improves physical security!

- this limits the number of people who can quickly/easily navigate your
  phone/content (if your phone leaves your sight for a few minutes)
  - also, over-the-shoulder and remote screenscraping becomes a bit harder.
  - and if someone gets data/info they shouldn't have, you will know where to
    look/probe to find out who

#### it's tough, but well worth it.

- a huge plus about knowing 3+ languages is that it becomes much harder for
  the far-left to label you as a racist and have that label stick.
  - you will understand far more about the world. this will expand your mind
    and greatly expand your perspective/options

#### Diversity is a strength

- America really, really needs to increase the number of Swahili speakers (so
  that we can build bridges in Africa)
  - other african languages include: French, Arabic, Afrikaans, Portuguese,
    Amharic, Yoruba, Oromo, Zulu, English
- Languages are like membranes that filter information exchange. 
  - what this means:
    - the world is connected to America & the rest of the world through English
    - America is broadly connected to the rest of world through foreign
      languages.
  - so these broad connections to the rest of the world are a huge strategic
    advantage because they allow us to build bridges that facilitate economic
    growth -- which should always provide benefits to both parties in the
    relationship: we help them grow (and become more independent) and they help
    us grow

- but i'll bet you've heard none of that from CNN, huh...
