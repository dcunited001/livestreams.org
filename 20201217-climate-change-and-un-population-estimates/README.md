### Climate Change from a Conservative Perspective

- reframe the problem: controlling uncertainty & economic externalities
  - suddenly, climate change policy makes sense for conservatives ... sorta

### Harness the synergy between: 

- terraforming a "Green Sahara" 
- using sand to combat ocean dead-zones
- using algae-based photosynthesis and MOF's to combat carbon dioxide

## Reenvisioning Human Migrations

- using metaphors to electronic circuit components
  - to cover in more detail in a future livestream?

## Why Climate Alarmism is Misguided

- What is missing in all the physical climate change models is the potential
  change that results from mankind's reaction.
  - E.G: The hilarious dutch plan to dam the North
    - [The NEED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_European_Enclosure_Dam)
    - And again, the ["NEED"](https://bit.ly/389zgpS)

There are only a handful of differences between humans and animals:

1. Language (& thereby culture)
2. Social programming (cyclic & linear time)
3. A certain kind of self-consciousness (self)
4. An awareness of mortality that transcends three generations (death)
5. The ability to shape our environment (architecture)
  
## Predictions

  
#### A Global Decrease in Sea levels

if sealevels were to decrease, this would provide a buffer against geoeconomic &
geopolitical impacts of melting glaciers

1. this enables humanity to support more agriculture
2. the potential for migration crises is minimized
  - this promotes geopolitical stability
3. this reduces the impact that water levels have on ocean pollution

- each of these factors are constructively "in phase"
  - they are otherwise mostly independent factors 

#### Deserts are Either Terraformed or Otherwise Utilized

#### The English Channel Becomes A River

#### Missing Links in Human History are Discovered 

- in the Northern Sahara, on the Arabian Peninsula, in the Persian Gulf and in
  the Baltic Sea.

- What happened to the North Saharan Cultures?
  - They followed the animals (southward)

- [Groundwater qanat potential mapping using frequency ratio and Shannonâ€™s
  entropy models in the Moghan watershed,
  Iran](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12145-014-0145-7)
  - i.e. Qanat Access Shafts And Channels Align With The Flow of Water Along The
    Bedrock, which should comport to the design/construction of Qanat on the
    Arabian Peninsula
    - which means that if there are lost river systems on the arabian peninsula,
      then the locations of qanat should trace them out.

## Climate Change

#### pollution >>> carbon dioxide

- entropy is the devil

#### Metal Organic Frameworks

- Transforming Carbon
- Maintaining Climate Homeostasis
- Production of Water
- Natural Gas Storage

## Terraforming

#### The Sahara

- milancovitch cycles
- expands land-based food production in northern africa
  - provides potential for population growth (and thereby economic growth)
- requires desalinization (which requires energy)
  - resource extraction from desalinized waste-water

- ancient lake/river systems
  - shape the most efficiently engineered basis for terraformed irrigation
    systems that will emerge
    - that is, the Sahara should revert to its former geography

#### The Pacific Dead Zones

- iron fertilization
- expands ocean-based food production


#### Greenland and the Arctic Coastline


#### Seafloor

- Mining metals from polymetallic nodules on the seafloor

- Why extremophile ecosystems do not, at all, affect CO2
  - why this completely misses the point

- 24 Trillion Free Hours of Supercomputer Time
  - each isolated extremophile environment represents up to 24 Trillion free
    hours of bioinformatic supercomputer time.

- Synthetic biology to extract nickel/etc from underneath the seafloor
  - design a plant-like organism that is tree-like in shape, but does not depend
    on chlorophyll/sunlight

## UN Population Estimates

  - [How Certain?](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/popfacts/PopFacts_2019-6.pdf)
  - [Ten Key Findings](https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2019_10KeyFindings.pdf)
  - [Assumptions in Population Growth](https://assets.prb.org/pdf14/understanding-population-projections.pdf)

- The UN Population estimates take into account regional population growth rates
  and regional growth constraints (tending to cause exponential curves to become
  sigmoidal)
  - The UN severely underestimates the potential for food & energy production,
    thus underestimating the regional growth constraints
    - "They don't know what they don't know..."
  - However, given that the untapped potential for food/energy production also
    represents untapped potential for economic development -- and because of how
    the latter influences various existential factors -- then we are also
    underestimating the population growth rates for many regions growth rates.
    - why do people have children? there is no serious answer to this question
      that doesn't include existential factors.

#### Square Roots (Kendall Musk)

- Relation to how Roman Infrastructure shaped European Geopolitics 
  - i.e. Roads and Aqueducts allowed Rome to ....
- similarly, decoupling agriculture from it's geographic constraints results in
  a huge increase in mankind's potential food production.
  - this is completely unaccounted for by the UN Population estimates

#### Econimic and Political consequences of Agriculture Potential

-  also unaccounted for are the long-term international economic projections of
   a larger sustainable population for Earth. 
   - this means there is more potential for growth (and peace) before mankind is
     forced to "the expanse"

- Power to the people
  - food production closer to the population means less reliance on economic
    specialization, which means more stability and economic resiliance.
- Stability in Africa and the Middle East is buffered by cheap food 

#### Perpetuating the potential for economic growth

- we need to perpetuate the potential for economic growth to encourage
  cooperation for long enough to develop technologies to transcend the needs of
  the human condition
  - there are a lot of negative dynamics that emerge when the sigmoid curve
    begins to bound a local/global population 
    - when groups run out of options to meet their own needs, their behavior
      becomes more constrained. they become more predictable. eventually, in the
      extreme, they become desperate.
